<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Base Isolation System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Elastomeric Isolator</li><li>Sliding Isolator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Base isolation system is a technique used in construction to reduce the impact of earthquakes on buildings and infrastructure. Elastomeric isolators are commonly used as they consist of rubber bearings that absorb and dissipate the seismic energy. They provide flexibility and allow for horizontal movement during an earthquake. On the other hand, sliding isolators are designed to allow the building to slide on a smooth surface during seismic events, reducing the forces transmitted to the structure. Both types are effective in protecting structures from earthquake-related damages.</p></p>
