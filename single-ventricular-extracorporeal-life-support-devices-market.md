<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Single-ventricular Extracorporeal Life Support Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>VA</li><li>VV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Single-ventricular extracorporeal life support devices, also known as ECMO devices, are used to support patients with severe heart or lung failure. The two main types of these devices are Venoarterial (VA) and Venovenous (VV) ECMO. VA ECMO provides support to both the heart and lungs by removing deoxygenated blood from the body and oxygenating it before returning it to the patient's circulatory system. VV ECMO, on the other hand, only supports the lungs by removing deoxygenated blood and returning oxygenated blood back to the patient's body. Both types are crucial in providing life-saving support to patients with organ failure.</p></p>
