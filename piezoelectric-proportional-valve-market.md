<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Piezoelectric Proportional Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Valves with Bender Element</li><li>Jet Valves with Multilayer Actuator</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Piezoelectric Proportional Valve market consists of two types: Valves with Bender Element and Jet Valves with Multilayer Actuator. Valves with Bender Element use a piezoelectric material that bends under an applied voltage, controlling the flow of fluid. On the other hand, Jet Valves with Multilayer Actuator use a stack of piezoelectric layers to generate mechanical displacement, resulting in fluid flow control. Both types of valves utilize the piezoelectric effect to achieve proportional control of fluid flow in various applications.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Piezoelectric Proportional Valve Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Benders with Monolayer Piezoceramic Plates</li><li>Benders with Multilayered Piezoceramic Plates</li><li>Multilayered Stack Piezoelectric Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The piezoelectric proportional valve market application refers to the use of piezoelectric materials in valves that can control the flow of fluids or gases. Benders with monolayer piezoceramic plates use a single layer of piezoelectric material to deflect when an electric field is applied, enabling precise control of the valve. Benders with multilayered piezoceramic plates utilize multiple layers of piezoelectric material to generate larger displacements and higher forces. Multilayered stack piezoelectric actuators are composed of multiple piezoceramic layers stacked together to provide even greater force and deflection capabilities.</p></p>
