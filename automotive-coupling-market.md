<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Coupling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid Couplings</li><li>Flexible Couplings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive coupling refers to the mechanism used to connect and transmit power between two or more shafts in a vehicle. There are two main types of automotive couplings: rigid couplings and flexible couplings. Rigid couplings are rigid and inflexible, allowing for high torque and precision transmission but limited misalignment compensation. On the other hand, flexible couplings are designed to absorb misalignments and shock loads, providing a smoother power transmission and reducing wear on the connected components. These different types of couplings cater to various automotive applications based on their specific requirements and performance characteristics.</p></p>
