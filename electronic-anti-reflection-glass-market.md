<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronic Anti-Reflection Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Treatment</li><li>Physical Processing</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Electronic Anti-Reflection Glass Market includes two main types: Chemical Treatment and Physical Processing. Chemical Treatment refers to the application of a thin, transparent coating on the glass surface, which reduces reflection and enhances visibility by minimizing the light that is bounced back. On the other hand, Physical Processing involves several techniques like etching, sandblasting, or adding microstructures to the glass surface, which help to scatter the light and reduce reflection. Both types aim to optimize light transmission, improve image quality, and minimize glare on electronic displays.</p></p>
