<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasonic Distance Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Analog Type</li><li>Digital Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Ultrasonic distance sensors are commonly classified into two types in the market - analog type and digital type. Analog type sensors provide continuous measurements of distance by generating an analog voltage output proportional to the measured distance. Digital type sensors, on the other hand, provide discrete distance measurements in digital form, typically using a microcontroller to convert the analog signal into digital data. Both types offer distance measurement capabilities, but the difference lies in the output format and how measurements are obtained.</p></p>
