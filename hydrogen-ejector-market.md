<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydrogen Ejector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Stage Ejector</li><li>Dual Stage Ejector</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The hydrogen ejector market consists of two main types: single stage ejectors and dual stage ejectors. Single stage ejectors are simple in design and are primarily used for low-pressure applications. They use one nozzle to create a vacuum and entrain hydrogen gas. On the other hand, dual stage ejectors are more complex and suitable for high-pressure operations. They have two sets of nozzles; the primary nozzle creates a vacuum, while the secondary nozzle entrains hydrogen gas. The choice between these types depends on the specific requirements of the hydrogen application.</p></p>
