<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Air Heating Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active Solar Heating</li><li>Passive Solar Heating</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Solar air heating systems can be categorized into two main types: active solar heating and passive solar heating. </p><p>Active solar heating systems use mechanical devices, such as fans or pumps, to circulate air through solar collectors to absorb and transfer heat. These systems are more complex and require additional components like controls and storage tanks to distribute the heated air.</p><p>Passive solar heating systems, on the other hand, rely on natural processes such as convection and radiation to move and distribute air. They don't require mechanical devices and instead rely on design features like large windows, heat-absorbing materials, and thermal mass to capture and circulate solar heat.</p></p>
