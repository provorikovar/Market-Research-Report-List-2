<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Pacemaker Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Heart Pacemaker</li><li>External Heart Pacemaker</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heart pacemaker market consists of two main types: implantable heart pacemakers and external heart pacemakers. Implantable heart pacemakers are small electronic devices surgically implanted into the chest to regulate the heart's electrical activity and ensure a regular heartbeat. They are suitable for patients with more severe heart conditions. On the other hand, external heart pacemakers are temporary devices worn outside the body. They are used in emergency situations or during surgeries to provide short-term electrical stimulation to the heart.</p></p>
