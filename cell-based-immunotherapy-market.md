<p><p>Cell-based immunotherapy, also known as cellular immunotherapy, is a form of cancer treatment that uses the body's own immune system to fight cancer cells. This approach involves modifying or enhancing the patient's immune cells, such as T cells, to recognize and attack cancer cells more effectively.</p><p>One of the key market drivers for cell-based immunotherapy is the increasing prevalence of cancer worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cancer is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for an estimated 9.6 million deaths in 2018. As the demand for effective cancer treatments rises, cell-based immunotherapy offers a promising solution.</p><p>Moreover, advancements in biotechnology have significantly contributed to the growth of the cell-based immunotherapy market. The development of gene-editing technologies, such as CRISPR-Cas9, has made it easier to modify immune cells and enhance their effectiveness against cancer cells. This has led to the development of novel therapies such as chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy, which has shown remarkable success in treating certain types of blood cancers.</p><p>Additionally, the increasing investments in research and development activities by pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are propelling market growth. Several companies and academic institutions are actively engaged in clinical trials and research to further improve the efficacy and safety of cell-based immunotherapies.</p><p>The cell-based immunotherapy market is also witnessing the emergence of innovative approaches and technologies. For example, the use of natural killer (NK) cells, which have inherent anti-tumor activity, is gaining traction in the field of immunotherapy. Moreover, the development of off-the-shelf CAR-T cell therapies is a significant trend in the market, as it eliminates the need for personalized treatments and reduces the time and cost associated with manufacturing patient-specific therapies.</p><p>In conclusion, the cell-based immunotherapy market is expected to experience significant growth during the forecast period. The increasing prevalence of cancer, advancements in biotechnology, and the emergence of innovative approaches are driving market expansion. The market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 14%, indicating a promising future for cell-based immunotherapy as an effective cancer treatment option.</p></p>
