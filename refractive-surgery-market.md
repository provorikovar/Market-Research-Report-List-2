<p><h1>Refractive Surgery Market Size, Market Trends, and Growth Outlook forecasted for period from 2024 to 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Refractive Surgery Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Refractive surgery, also known as vision correction surgery, is a surgical procedure performed to correct refractive errors such as nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), astigmatism, and presbyopia. The surgery changes the shape of the cornea, the outermost layer of the eye, to improve the way light is focused onto the retina, thus enhancing vision.</p><p>The refractive surgery market has experienced significant growth over the years and is expected to continue growing at a CAGR of 4.8% during the forecast period. The market growth can be attributed to several factors such as the increasing prevalence of refractive errors, technological advancements in surgical techniques and equipment, growing awareness and acceptance of refractive surgeries, and a rise in disposable income leading to higher affordability for such procedures.</p><p>One of the key trends observed in the refractive surgery market is the increasing adoption of minimally invasive procedures. With advancements in laser technology, refractive surgeries such as LASIK (Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis) have become less invasive and provide faster recovery times compared to traditional methods. This has led to a higher number of patients opting for refractive surgeries, driving market growth.</p><p>Another trend witnessed in the market is the rising demand for customized or personalized refractive surgeries. With the advent of wavefront technology, surgeons are able to map the individual characteristics of the eye, allowing for highly customized treatment plans. This personalized approach enhances the accuracy and precision of the surgery, resulting in better visual outcomes for patients.</p><p>In conclusion, the refractive surgery market is expected to witness steady growth in the coming years, driven by factors such as the increasing prevalence of refractive errors, technological advancements, and a growing preference for minimally invasive and personalized procedures. The market's projected CAGR of 4.8% indicates a positive outlook for the industry.</p></p>
