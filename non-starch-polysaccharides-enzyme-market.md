<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non-starch Polysaccharides Enzyme Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soluble</li><li>Insoluble</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-starch polysaccharides (NSP) are classified into two types: soluble and insoluble. Soluble NSPs are composed of polysaccharides that form viscous gels when mixed with water, such as pectins and gums. They are commonly found in fruits, vegetables, and legumes. These NSPs can be digested by specific enzymes produced by the body, resulting in the production of short-chain fatty acids. Insoluble NSPs, on the other hand, do not dissolve in water and provide bulk to the diet. They mainly consist of cellulose and lignin, which promote bowel movements and prevent constipation.</p></p>
