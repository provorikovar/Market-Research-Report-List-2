In addition, the growing importance of professional salons and beauty centers also contributes to the market growth.

Additionally, there is a rising demand for hair straighteners with temperature control settings, allowing users to choose the optimal heat level for their hair type.</p><p>According to the mentioned forecast, the hair straighteners market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.6% during the forecast period.
