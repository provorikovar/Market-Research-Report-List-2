<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The SPE Cartridge Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Reversed-Phase</li><li>Ion-Exchange</li><li>Normal Phase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>SPE (Solid-Phase Extraction) cartridges are commonly used in various industries for sample preparation. The market for these cartridges can be classified into three main types: reversed-phase, ion-exchange, and normal phase. Reversed-phase cartridges separate molecules based on their hydrophobicity, with non-polar compounds retaining on the cartridge. Ion-exchange cartridges exploit the exchange of ions between the sample and the stationary phase, allowing for separation of charged compounds. Normal phase cartridges separate molecules based on their polarity, with polar compounds being retained. These different types of cartridges cater to different analytical needs and industries.</p></p>
