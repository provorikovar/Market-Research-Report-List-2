<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Solar Street Lights Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Standalone</li><li>Grid Connected</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Smart solar street lights are classified into two types: standalone and grid connected. Standalone solar street lights are equipped with an independent solar panel, battery, and lighting unit. They operate off-grid, using the energy generated by the solar panel and stored in the battery to power the lights at night. Grid connected solar street lights, on the other hand, are connected to the main power grid. They can draw electricity from the grid during cloudy days or when the battery runs out of power, ensuring continuous illumination.</p></p>
