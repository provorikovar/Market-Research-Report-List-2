<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hydraulic Gear Wheel Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>External Gear Hydraulic Gear Wheel Pump</li><li>Internal Gear Hydraulic Gear Wheel Pump</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Hydraulic gear wheel pumps are classified into two main types: External Gear and Internal Gear. </p><p>External Gear Hydraulic Gear Wheel Pump consists of two gears, an outer gear and an inner gear. The outer gear is driven by external power, causing the inner gear to rotate. This creates suction which draws in hydraulic fluid, and as the gears mesh, the fluid is forced out through the outlet.</p><p>On the other hand, Internal Gear Hydraulic Gear Wheel Pump has an outer gear and an inner gear that mesh internally. The outer gear is driven by external power, rotating the inner gear in the opposite direction. This creates suction and forces hydraulic fluid to flow out.</p><p>Both types of hydraulic gear wheel pumps are widely used to generate hydraulic power in various industries.</p></p>
