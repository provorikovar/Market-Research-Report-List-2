<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Low-E Glass Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Sputtered (Soft Coating)</li><li>Pyrolytic (Hard Coating)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Low-E Glass Coating Market Types - Sputtered (Soft Coating) and Pyrolytic (Hard Coating) are two different methods used to apply a coating on glass surfaces. Sputtered coating involves the deposition of multiple layers of metal or metallic oxide onto the glass through a vacuum-based process. This coating provides excellent insulation properties and allows a high level of light transmission. On the other hand, Pyrolytic coating is applied during the float glass manufacturing process and is fused with the glass itself, resulting in a hard and durable coating. Pyrolytic coatings offer better solar control and durability compared to sputtering.</p></p>
