<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multimode Dark Fiber Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Step-index Multimode Fiber</li><li>Graded-index Multimode Fiber</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The multimode dark fiber market includes two types: step-index multimode fiber and graded-index multimode fiber. Step-index multimode fiber has a core with a uniform refractive index while its cladding has a lower refractive index. This causes the light signal to bounce along the fiber, resulting in modal dispersion. In contrast, graded-index multimode fiber has a core with varying refractive index, gradually decreasing from the center to the edge. This reduces modal dispersion by allowing different light paths to converge at the same time, thus increasing the carrying capacity of the fiber.</p></p>
