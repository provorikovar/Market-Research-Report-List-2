<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LED Curing Light Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cordless</li><li>Corded</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The LED curing light market is divided into two types: cordless and corded. A cordless LED curing light is powered by a rechargeable battery, providing greater flexibility and convenience during dental procedures. It allows for easy maneuverability and reduces the risk of tangling or pulling on the cord. On the other hand, a corded LED curing light requires a constant power source, typically through a power cord. While it may limit mobility, it ensures a consistent power supply and eliminates the need for recharging. Both types offer their own advantages and are commonly used in dental practices.</p></p>
