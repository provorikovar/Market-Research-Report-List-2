<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Soil Permeability Apparatus Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Constant Head Soil Permeability Apparatus</li><li>Falling Head Soil Permeability Apparatus</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Soil permeability apparatus market types refer to the two different methods used to measure the permeability of soil. The constant head soil permeability apparatus measures the rate at which water flows through a soil specimen under a constant pressure head. On the other hand, the falling head soil permeability apparatus measures the rate at which water flow decreases over time as the water level in a soil specimen decreases. These apparatus are used in geotechnical engineering and soil testing to determine the permeability characteristics of soil samples.</p></p>
